   ```

3. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Enable GitHub Pages

After repository is created:

1. Go to repository Settings tab
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Configure:
   ```
   Source: Deploy from a branch
   Branch: main
   Folder: / (root)
   ```

## 3. Push Code to GitHub

After repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
# Push to GitHub (repository already configured)
git push -u origin main

# Verify push success
git remote -v
git log --oneline
```

## 4. Test Deployment

After push, test these URLs:

### Repository:
https://github.com/adbecolearn/ecolearn-auth

### GitHub Pages (available in 2-3 minutes):
https://adbecolearn.github.io/ecolearn-auth/

### Features to Test:
- [ ] Authentication forms (login, register, forgot)
- [ ] Tab navigation
- [ ] Real-time validation
- [ ] Password strength indicator
- [ ] Carbon footprint tracking
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Logo display (text-only design)

## 5. Integration Ready

After deployment, the authentication system will be available for:

### Other Micro Frontends:
```javascript
// Redirect to auth when needed
window.location.href = 'https://adbecolearn.github.io/ecolearn-auth/';

// Check auth status
import { authUtils } from 'https://adbecolearn.github.io/ecolearn-shared/index.js';
if (!authUtils.isAuthenticated()) {
    window.location.href = 'https://adbecolearn.github.io/ecolearn-auth/';
}
```

### Backend Integration:
```javascript
// API endpoints ready for:
POST https://ecolearn-api.run.app/v1/auth/login
